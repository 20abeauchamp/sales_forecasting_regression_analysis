# sales_forecasting_regression_analysis
Excel-based regression and statistical analysis of customer transaction data to identify sales drivers and evaluate forecasting potential.

## Key Findings

- Age group 35–52 showed statistically higher spending than younger customers (p = 0.0369).
- Gender was not a significant predictor of sales.
- Transaction count showed a positive but weak relationship with total sales (R² = 0.213).
- Multivariate modeling revealed that price, quantity, product category, and payment method are stronger predictors of total sales than demographic variables alone.
